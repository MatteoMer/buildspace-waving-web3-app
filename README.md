# Basic Solidity project for buildspace : WavePortal

The basic usage of this contract is to allow the user to send a transaction to the blockchain to wave at the owner of the contract (and leave a message)

You can see the front-end part of this project [here](https://github.com/MatteoMer/buildspace-waving-web3-app-frontend)
